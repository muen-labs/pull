"use client"

/**
 * The demo guide — a wizard bar across the top of every demo surface.
 *
 * The hackathon demo is a script with three acts (DEMO.md), and the person on stage has
 * to hold two things at once: where the story is, and what to press next. This bar holds
 * both — the three acts as one track, the act currently on screen named with its
 * instruction, and a next press that moves to the following act's opening screen.
 *
 * It renders from the root layout and stays on every screen — the landing, the studio, the
 * dark client board, the intake form, the canvas, the dev surfaces. A guide that vanishes on
 * half the screens is a guide the presenter has to remember instead of read.
 *
 * It sits in the flow instead of sticky on purpose: the site header and the studio
 * header are both sticky at `top: 0`, and a third sticky layer would fight them.
 *
 * Dismissal collapses the bar to a single row rather than hiding it outright — a guide
 * you can lose with no way back is a trap, so the collapsed row says what it is and
 * takes one press to restore. The choice is remembered per browser.
